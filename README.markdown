# TechTXT-Detector extension for Chrome

This extension checks a site's domain for a tech.txt file and displays a small
icon in the address bar if the presence of such a file was detected.


**Warning:** This extension is experimental right now!


## What is a tech.txt file?

The idea of a tech.txt file is similar to a humans.txt but only contains
information about the technologies used on this site. As with humans.txt files
there are no strict rules on how its content should be formatted. As long as a
human can read it, it's file :-)
